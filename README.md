Title: Disease Detection and Classification in Plant Leaves Using Live Video Feed
Description:
In agriculture. the early detection and classification of plant diseases are crucial for ensuring crop health and yield. This use case focuses on the application of computer vision technology to detect and classify diseases in plant leaves using video feeds from field cameras or drones.
Key Features:
1. Video Feed Analysis:
• The system continuously analyzes video feeds capturing plant leaves from various angles and distances. 	It processes the video frames in real-time to identify plant leaves.
2. Disease Detection:
• The system employs nuchine learning models and computer vision algorithms to detect disease symptoms on plant leaves.
• It identifies visual cues such as discoloration, lesions. spots, or deformities that indicate the presence of a disease.
3. Disease Clmssification:
• Once a disease is detected, the system classifies it into specific categories or types.
• It uses a database of known plant diseases to match the symptoms and make accurate classifications.
4. Alert Generation:
• The system generates real-time alerts when it detects diseases in plant leaves, including the type and severity ofthe disease.
• Alerts can be sent to farmers or agricultural experts via email, SMS, or a dedicated app.
This use case showcases the potential of computer vision in revolutionizing agriculture by automating disease detection and classification in plants. By continuously monitoring plant leaves through video feeds, farmers and agricultural experts can take proactive measures to protect crops, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve the sustainability ofagriculture.
